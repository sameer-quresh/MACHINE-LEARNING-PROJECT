# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT
 # FAKE REVIEW DETECTION
My project is “Fake Review Detection “ using Chrome Extension, I have built an exclusive AI model for detection of fake reviews given by user by using a machine learning named LSTM model which gave 98% accurate results for all its predictions on any E-commerce website from startups to MNCs. This chrome extension is efficient in all the languages known in world, today. The main purpose of this project is to detect whether the review given by user is actually genuine or a fake(paid) review. It took me few months to build this project and I worked with a group of few friends and some industry experts as well to successfully launch this project. We Worked day and nights to come up with the solution for this problem. As of now, I have a few customers using my chrome extension and they are pretty satisfied with the working of this extension as it is more user friendly and as friendly as every Google Chrome Extension. The desired user can set up my user script and can use it and whenever you visit an e-commerce website to buy a product, you need to enable the extension and copy -paste the customer review and it will analyse whether the review is genuine or fake/paid review. I have uploaded the related files on my GitHub account.
I’m also working on publication of a paper with the encouragement of my project guide and assistance of my teammates on this working model, that, I have built.
